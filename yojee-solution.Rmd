Case 1:  A delivery company IParcel delivers packages to certain locations every day. Below is a sample set of the lat and lngs.
•	1 parcel per location for the sake of simplicity
•	There are n number of delivery boys riding motorcycles available

The purpose of this problem is to come up with an efficient path for each of the 25 drivers from a central distribution point (11.552931,104.933636).

Things we expect
•	Code on a git repo
•	Efficiency in running the problem
•	Any visualisation that you can think of
•	Ideas on how you plan to scale this if the number of locations increase (more warehouses and distribution points). Also how this can be translated to engineering infrastructure if need be.
•	Problem statement is purposefully at a very high level. If you have any new ideas we didn’t think of, would be a bonus.

*Please also find the attached sample csv file.
